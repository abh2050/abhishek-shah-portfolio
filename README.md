## ðŸš€ Deployment

This portfolio is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Automatic Deployment

Every push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a deployment to GitHub Pages. The site will be available at:
`https://abh2050.github.io/abhishek-shah-portfolio/`

### Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually using the provided script:

```sh
# Option 1: Use npm script (builds and deploys)
npm run deploy

# Option 2: Use deployment script directly
./deploy.sh
```

### Deployment Process

1. **GitHub Actions**: The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file defines the CI/CD pipeline
2. **Build Process**: Runs `npm run build` to create production assets
3. **Deploy**: Uploads the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages

### Requirements for Deployment

- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings
- Set the source to "GitHub Actions" in Pages settings
- The repository must be public (for free GitHub Pages) or you need GitHub Pro/Team

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**
